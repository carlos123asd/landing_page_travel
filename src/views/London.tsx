                    <p>London is known for its rainy weather, but we had the luck to arrive on a sunny day. Perfect for a walk along the River Thames to explore the famous bridges of London.</p>
                    <p>Sunny weather in London? Yes, somehow. At least after we arrived with a delay of two hours, because of bad weather conditions near the airport. But it was great to catch some rays of sunshine in late December.</p>
                    <p><mark style={{background:"#454A54",color:"white"}}>The first photo shows the Tower Bridge, which is often mistaken with the London Bridge.</mark> You even get more photos of the Tower Bridge than of the London Bridge when searching for "London Bridge". The latter looks pretty ugly, so don't be disappointed.</p>
                    <p>It was one of the first photos I took in London and also the first time I used my ZEISS Touit 2.8/12 lens, a lens I've used a lot during the trip. The underground of London in particular has a lot to offer, making a wide-angle lens a good choice.</p>
                    <p><mark style={{background:"#454A54",color:"white"}}>The Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom. You can see it on the second photo.</mark> It offers an observation deck on Level 72 that was opened to the public in 2013. The name of the building is easy to remember as it indeed looks like â€¦ a shard.</p>
